SDM/app/test folder

This folder and its subfolders contain ongoing test applications for the SDM system.
Documentation about these tests is mostly non-existent.  This folder will be provided
with releases for those who may be interested.

The SDM/app/test/ folder contains generic tests for the SDM system.

The SDM/app/test/ClassTests/ folder contains tests for SDM classes.

The SDM/app/test/DMTests/ folder contains tests specific to the Data Manager.



Most of these applications should be started similarly to how the Process Manager would
start-up applications.  That is, with the same command-line string.
	$ ./APPNAME TM-Address DM-Address SDM-PID
For example:
	$ ./SearchTest 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 56
