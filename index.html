     <h4>Introduction</h4>
	 <p>The Virtual Network Protocol Development is based on the US government funded Space Plug-and-Play 
	 Avionics development which has been released to the public in 2012 as open source.</p>
	<p>
	The intention of this open source development is to explore further how Virtual Networks can be established
	efficiently for various systems using a self-describing, self-organizing software standard with possiblity
	of reusing Applications much similar as Android/IOS phone and tabel apps.<BR>The VN-sdm is a part of the Virtual Network Protocol effort.

	<h4>Annoncement</h4>

<p>Inspired by the Space Plug-and-Play Architecture (SPA) standard, <a hef="http://www.mdh.se">Malardalen
University</a> and <a href="http://www.adv.bruhnspace.com">Bruhnspace Advanced Projects AB (BAP)</a> has initiated an
effort to evolve the software protocol part of the US developed SPA infrastructure
to better adopt to all kinds of unmanned systems, including CubeSatellites
and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.</p>
<p>
This effort is named Virtual Network Protocol (VNP) and is backwards
compatible with SDM v1.10.3a from which the work is forked. VNP is released
as open source and open community development at GitHub. Anyone can
and may join the community driven development as well as visit Malardalen
University's demonstrator laboratory for underwater vehicles and satellite
research and education.</p>

<p>VNP Project page: <a href="http://virtual-network.github.io/vn-sdm/">http://virtual-network.github.io/vn-sdm/</a><BR>
VNP Software page: <a href="https://github.com/virtual-network">https://github.com/virtual-network</a></p>

<p>VNP is compatible with the software description found in draft SPA standard
from 2011 while removing the compliance with Test-bypass, microD, nanoD connectors,
5 V, 28 V, 50 x 50 mm2 bracket mounting holes, etc.</p>
<p>The compliance includes the following parts, excluding references to parts removed
as defined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>UUID, RFC 4122 Standard
<li>SPA Local Subnet Standard
<li>SPA Logical Interface Standard
<li>SPA Networking Standard
<li>SPA Ontology Standard
<li>SPA System Capabilities Standard
<li>SPA SpaceWire Subnet Adaptation
<li>Draft SPA-1 standard
</ul>
<p>
VNP will introduce the following additions in the near term:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved error handling
<li>Bug fixes
<li>VNP Controller Area Network, VN-CAN interface
<li>VNP I2C Network, VN-I2C interface (updated SPA-1/Mini PnP) 
</ul>
<p>
VNP has removed compliance with: </p>
<ul>
<li>SPA Physical Interface Standard
<li>SPA System Capabilities standard
<li>SPA Test Bypass
</ul>
<p>VNP will be used by the students and researchers at Malardalen University
Master's and Doctoral programs in Robotics for different projects starting fall
2013.</p>
<p>
Development of a Hard real-time and verifiable software VN core implementation called
VN-sdm-ADA is being discussed. VN-sdm-ADA would be written in ADA language, utilize sockets,
and be verified using UPPAAL. <a href="http://www.uppaal.org">http://www.uppaal.org</a>
<BR>Information regarding this will be posted on the community portal.
</p>
<p>Please spread to your colleagues and others that may have an interest.</p>
